# off by one bugs are a common software failure pattern (bug)
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error
# the NOTE below discusses the correctness of this code in Python
# Porting this code to other languages will require care when 
# considering this section of code.

# NOTE
# start_pos starts at 0 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering
# while respondent_count is a natural number and starts at 1.
# If both were zero-based, we would need to compare them with "<=" since
# Python includes the start position when slicing an array but EXCLUDES 
# the end position. However, since start_pos has a value one less than the
# cardinal number of the respondent to which it refers, using "<" is 
# appropriate in Python.
